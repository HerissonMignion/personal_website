# Welcome to my website

I have always been passionate about computers since I was in my early
teens and I was building redstone computers in Minecraft.  Nowadays I
am a Linux user and I want to study every aspects of computers, from
hardware to software, even though I have a preference for the software
side of things.

I have made youtube videos to explain things I find interesting or to
show how to do things, but I get tired of making youtube videos.
Youtube videos are also an inferior medium for searchability, and I
also struggle between making videos in French who benefit less people,
or in English where my pronounciation of English is so so. Here I'll
be trying to run a blog website and write posts to share the things I
want to share.
